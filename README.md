## Welcome to my GitHub Page!

I'm a IT enthusiast since my childhood and have being learning and working things in many areas. I have professional experience in _Support, Training, Consultancy and Development_.
Last one has been my major interest recently, so I'm focused to become a *Fullstack Web Developer* and I'm always willing to check new opportunities.
So, don't hesitate to [reach me out](https://linkedin.com/trepichio) if you would like to.

### So, what's this about?

Here is my GitHub Page where I present some good and fun stuffs done by myself when learning anything through any kind of material such as articles, blogs, books, tutorials, etc. This is kind of a portfolio, so anyone who interested can check out any of source code available in their respective repositories in [my Github Profile](https://github.com/trepichio) and many more over there.

### Let's cut to the chase right away!

Ok. Enough bla bla bla! Here are some things done when learning:
- Javascript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Node.js
- Vue.js

I have used many resources like Books, Tutorial videos, Blog articles.
I will be soon listing my favourites one.

Below it is a list of a few of my repositories and some deployed VueJS SPA.
